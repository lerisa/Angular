<!-- ViewChild allows a one component to be injected into another, giving the parent access to its attributes and functions. 
    One caveat, however, is that child wonâ€™t be available until after the view has been initialized. 
    This means we need to implement the AfterViewInit lifecycle hook to receive the data from the child. -->
