  When you have data that should aways been in sync, RxJS BehaviorSubject is very useful in this situation.
  -It will always return the current value on subscription - there is no need to call onnext
  -It has a getValue() function to extract the last value as raw data.
  -It ensures that the component always receives the most recent data.
